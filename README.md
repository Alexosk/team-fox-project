# Team-fox-project
This is a school project for making an interactive mockup of a LMS (Learning Management System). The system is meant for developing a better control over educations as well as better overview for both students and teachers. It is written with only static HTML-pages with CSS and then JavaScript is used to simulate a real system. There is no backend, database or JavaScript-frameworks. 

## Getting Started
Run index.html in a browser, preferably Chrome. 

## Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites

## Local server (optional)
There is an option to run a local Node server if you want to host the page locally and in that case Node.js is required. 

To run the server type the following at the command line:

```
node server.js

```
The server will now run on your local machine i.e. "http://10.7.2.117". 

## Basic design
The page is based upon a "header", "content" and "footer" design. Media-queries and Flex-box are used to enable a responsive design for different screen sizes. The content area uses columns to divide content if necessary.
