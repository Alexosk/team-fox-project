# Team-fox-project
This is a school project for making an interactive mockup of a LMS (Learning Management System). The system is meant for developing a better control over educations as well as better overview for both students and teachers. Only static HTML-pages are used with CSS and JavaScript to simulate a real system. No backend or database. 

## Getting Started
Run index.html in a browser, preferably Chrome. 

## Prerequisites
There's an option to run a local Node server if you want to host the page locally and in that case Node.js is required. 

To run the server type the following at the command line:

```
node server.js

```

## Installing
No installation needed.
