# Team-fox-project
This is a school project for making an interactive mockup of a LMS (Learning Management System). The system is meant for developing a better control over educations as well as better overview for both students and teachers. Only static HTML-pages with CSS and JavaScript are used to simulate a real system. No backend, database or JavaScript-frameworks. 

## Getting Started
Run index.html in a browser, preferably Chrome. 

## Prerequisites
There's an option to run a local Node server if you want to host the page locally and in that case Node.js is required. 

To run the server type the following at the command line:

```
node server.js

```
The server will now run on your local machine i.e. "10.7.2.117". 

## Basic design
The page is based upon a <header>, <content> and <footer>. Media-queries and Flex-box are used to enable a responsive design for different screen sizes. The content area uses columns to dived content if necessary. 

## Built with
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- [ChartJS](http://www.chartjs.org)
- Node.js

## Installing
